# Extension Developer Guide

Build native C++ extensions for X4: Foundations using the X4Native framework.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (MSVC, C++23)
- CMake 3.20+
- X4Native installed in the game's `extensions/x4native/` folder

## Project Structure

An extension is a standard X4 extension folder with a native DLL:

```
extensions/x4native_mymod/
  content.xml         ← X4 extension manifest
  x4native.json       ← X4Native config (name, DLL path, priority)
  native/
    x4native_mymod.dll
```

### content.xml

Standard X4 extension descriptor. Must declare `x4native` as a dependency:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<content version="900" id="x4native_mymod" name="My Mod"
         description="My native extension." author="you"
         date="2026-01-01" save="0" enabled="1">
  <dependency id="x4native" optional="false" />
  <text language="44" name="My Mod" description="My native extension." />
</content>
```

- `save="0"` — extension doesn't affect save compatibility (use `1` only if your mod adds persistent data that breaks saves without it)
- `<text language="44" ...>` — optional localization override (language 44 = English); omit if not needed
- `version` in the root `<content>` element reflects the **game version** this was built for (900 = 9.00)

### x4native.json

Tells the framework where to find your DLL and how to load it:

```json
{
    "name": "mymod",
    "library": "native\\x4native_mymod.dll",
    "priority": 100,
    "min_api_version": 1
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Extension identifier (used in logs) |
| `library` | Yes | Relative path to your DLL |
| `priority` | No | Load order (lower = earlier, default 0) |
| `min_api_version` | No | Minimum framework API version required |
| `autoreload` | No | `true` → watch DLL for changes and hot-reload in-place (default `false`) |

## Minimal Extension

```cpp
#include <x4native.h>

X4N_EXTENSION {
    x4n::log::info("Hello from my extension!");

    x4n::on("on_game_loaded", [] {
        x4n::log::info("Game world is ready!");
    });
}

X4N_SHUTDOWN {
    x4n::log::info("Goodbye!");
}
```

`X4N_EXTENSION` runs when the framework loads your DLL. `X4N_SHUTDOWN` runs on unload. The framework auto-cleans event subscriptions and hooks on shutdown, but explicit cleanup is good practice.

## CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(x4native_mymod)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 23)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_library(x4native_mymod SHARED mymod.cpp)

target_include_directories(x4native_mymod PRIVATE
    path/to/x4native/sdk
)

set_target_properties(x4native_mymod PROPERTIES
    PREFIX ""
    OUTPUT_NAME "x4native_mymod"
)
```

Build: `cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 && cmake --build build --config Debug`

## API Reference

All API functions live in the `x4n::` namespace. Include `<x4native.h>`.

### Lifecycle Events

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `on_game_loaded` | Game world is initialized and safe to call game functions |
| `on_game_save` | Game is being saved |
| `on_ui_reload` | Lua state rebuilt (after `/reloadui`) |
| `on_frame_update` | Every UI frame tick |

### Events

```cpp
// Subscribe (returns subscription ID)
int id = x4n::on("on_game_loaded", [] { /* no params */ });
int id = x4n::on("event_name", [](const char* p) { /* string param from Lua */ });
int id = x4n::on("event_name", [](void* p) { /* raw pointer from C++ raise */ });

// Unsubscribe
x4n::off(id);

// Raise a C++ event (other extensions can subscribe to it)
x4n::raise("my_custom_event");
x4n::raise("my_custom_event", my_data_ptr);  // subscribers get void*

// Raise a Lua event (C++ → Lua)
x4n::raise_lua("my_lua_event_name", "optional_param");
```

### Lua Event Bridges

Forward game Lua events into C++ without writing any Lua:

```cpp
// Register bridge (call during on_game_loaded)
x4n::bridge_lua_event("playerUndocked", "on_player_undocked");

// Subscribe — string param from Lua is forwarded automatically
x4n::on("on_player_undocked", [](const char* param) {
    x4n::log::info("Player undocked (param: %s)", param ? param : "none");
});

// Or subscribe without params if you don't need them
x4n::on("on_player_undocked", [] { x4n::log::info("A ship undocked!"); });
```

### Custom MD Event Forwarding

Some game events (e.g. `event_object_destroyed`, `event_player_money_updated`) only exist in the Mission Director system and have no Lua equivalent. To use them in C++, your extension needs two pieces:

**1. MD cue** — add an XML file in your extension's `md/` folder (the game auto-discovers all `*.xml` files there; no registration in `content.xml` needed):

```xml
<!-- md/my_events.xml -->
<mdscript name="MyModEvents"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="md.xsd">
  <cues>
    <cue name="mymod_ObjectDestroyed" instantiate="true">
      <conditions>
        <event_object_destroyed />
      </conditions>
      <actions>
        <raise_lua_event name="'mymod.object_destroyed'" />
      </actions>
    </cue>
  </cues>
</mdscript>
```

**2. Bridge to C++** in your extension code:

```cpp
X4N_EXTENSION {
    x4n::on("on_game_loaded", [] {
        x4n::bridge_lua_event("mymod.object_destroyed", "on_object_destroyed");
    });

    x4n::on("on_object_destroyed", [](const char* param) {
        x4n::log::info("Destroyed: %s", param ? param : "unknown");
    });
}
```

The full flow is: **Game Engine → MD cue → `raise_lua_event` → Lua bridge → C++ event**. This is the same pattern X4Native itself uses for `on_game_loaded` and `on_game_saved`.

### Logging

```cpp
x4n::log::debug("value = %d", 42);
x4n::log::info("loaded %s", name);
x4n::log::warn("something odd");
x4n::log::error("failed: %s", reason);
```

Output goes to `extensions/x4native/x4native.log`. Uses printf-style formatting.

### Game Functions

2,051 typed game functions resolved from `X4.exe` exports:

```cpp
// Cache the table pointer during init
static X4GameFunctions* game = nullptr;

X4N_EXTENSION {
    game = x4n::game();
}

// Call game functions (only after on_game_loaded!)
void on_game_loaded() {
    UniverseID player = game->GetPlayerID();
    const char* name = game->GetComponentName(player);
    bool docked = game->IsPlayerValid();
}
```

Browse `sdk/x4_game_func_table.h` for the full function list.

### Function Hooks

Intercept game function calls with before/after hooks:

```cpp
// Before-hook: args by reference, can modify or skip the original
static void before_fn(x4n::hook::HookControl& ctl,
                      UniverseID& id, uint32_t& count) {
    x4n::log::info("intercepted call with id=%llu", id);
    // ctl.skip_original = 1;  // skip the real function
}

// After-hook: args by value (read-only)
static void after_fn(UniverseID id, uint32_t count) {
    x4n::log::info("call completed");
}

// Install (returns hook ID, 0 on failure)
int h1 = x4n::hook::before<&X4GameFunctions::SomeFunction>(before_fn);
int h2 = x4n::hook::after<&X4GameFunctions::SomeFunction>(after_fn);

// Remove
x4n::hook::remove(h1);
x4n::hook::remove(h2);
```

Install hooks in `on_game_loaded`. The framework auto-removes hooks when your extension unloads.

### Info

```cpp
x4n::game_version();  // "9.00"
x4n::version();       // "0.9.0 (game: 9.00)"
x4n::path();          // "G:\...\extensions\x4native_mymod\"
```

## Hot-Reload Workflow

Extension DLLs use the same copy-on-load pattern as the framework core: the original DLL is never locked by the game process. This means you can **rebuild your extension while the game is running** and have it reload automatically.

### Manual reload
Trigger `/reloadui` at any time — the framework unloads all extensions, copies the new binaries, and reinitializes everything.

### Automatic per-extension reload
Set `"autoreload": true` in your `x4native.json`. The framework polls your DLL's modification time every ~2 seconds (120 frames). When a change is detected, it hot-reloads **only your extension** without disturbing others or triggering a full UI reload:

1. Build your DLL (original is never file-locked, overwrite freely)
2. The framework detects the new mtime within ~2 seconds
3. Your extension is shut down, the new binary is loaded, and `X4N_EXTENSION` runs again

Each extension controls its own autoreload independently via its `x4native.json`.

> **Never ship `"autoreload": true` in a release build.** The framework always tracks DLL mtimes when the flag is set — polling every frame, comparing file timestamps, and unloading/reloading the DLL mid-session. This adds overhead and is a development-only tool. Your released `x4native.json` must have `"autoreload": false` or omit the field entirely.

## Important Notes

- **Never call game functions before `on_game_loaded`** — the game world isn't ready yet.
- **All code runs on the UI thread** — no threading required, no thread safety concerns.
- **Extensions are auto-cleaned on unload** — hooks and event subscriptions are removed automatically, but explicit cleanup in `X4N_SHUTDOWN` is recommended.
- **Protected UI mode must be OFF** in game settings for native extensions to work.
- **Game updates may break hooks** — function signatures or addresses can change between patches.

## Examples

See the `examples/` folder for working extensions:

| Example | Demonstrates |
|---------|-------------|
| `hello` | Lifecycle events, game function calls, logging |
| `event_test` | Event round-trips (C++→Lua→C++), frame updates |
| `hook_test` | Before/after hooks on a game function |
| `lua_bridge` | Dynamic Lua→C++ event forwarding |
